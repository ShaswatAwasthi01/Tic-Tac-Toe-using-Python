# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-Python
 Python is a simple and easy to understand language. Also, I am using python since long time. Therefore, I have designed my childhood game (tic-tac-toe) in Python language.
 I have  written a code for the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python Language. This is a single player game. One player is the user himself and the second player will be the computer system itself. So, this will be a very tough game to win.
